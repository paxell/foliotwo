      <h1 id="eleanor-paxman-product-designer">Eleanor Paxman: <br />Product Designer</h1>
<p>In my 12+ years of experience in a broad range of design roles and contexts, my career expertise could be summarised as this: evolving products. </p>
<p>My expertise in product design for data-driven web applications draws from a wide range of experiences in the design of games, mobile apps, logos and branding.</p>
<p>I work with product managers and researchers, leading a design team to take user needs and propose solutions for them: wireframe, prototype, test, iterate, repeat. I work with developers and quality assurance until the user need is satisfied within the current constraints.</p>
<p>Although products can be released, I understand they are never 'done'. A user needs the products they use to evolve with them as technology marches forward and their expectations change.</p>
<h2 id="areas-of-strength">Areas of strength</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Product strategy:</strong> from print to screen, desktop to mobile, native desktop to cloud application, I've spent a lot of time figuring out how to take a product from one stage of it's life cycle to another.</li>
<li><strong>Managing constraints:</strong> even considering legacy architecture, release schedules and budget constraints, there are always ways to improve a product from micro-interactions to macro re-platforming.</li>
<li><strong>Improving processes:</strong> applying the same agile principles of product development to the processes we rely on to keep things moving in the wider business, and always re-evaluating: did that work?</li>
<li><strong>Connecting silos:</strong> highlighting common goals while appreciating the individual contributions of geographically distributed interdisciplinary team members (say that five times fast).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="areas-of-interest">Areas of interest</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Business needs:</strong> Squaring user needs with business needs is a fine balance. As designers we want our users to have everything, as a business we need to ask ourselves: what adds the most value?</li>
<li><strong>Designing automation:</strong> Products should make themselves (almost) redundant so that users spend less time working with the app and let the app work for them. I have only just begun to scratch the surface here.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership:</strong> I've implemented recruitment processes which improved hiring. I've co-ordinated a team of designers and supervised junior designers but I'm always learning more about how best to lead a design team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="active-skills-and-tools">Active skills and tools</h2>
<ul>
<li>User flows, wireframing and prototyping</li>
<li>Mockups and pattern libraries with design tools such as Sketch</li>
<li>Designing workshops with collaboration tools such as Miro</li>
<li>Styling with CSS and CSS preprocessors</li>
<li>JavaScript and common libraries such as React</li>
<li>Agile software methodology</li>
<li>Version control using Git</li>
<li>Adobe CC: Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="retired-skills-and-tools">Retired skills and tools</h2>
<p>Why would I include these? In my career evolving products from one stage to another, I have used many tools, some of which I no longer use but have taught me a lot along the way.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hand coded HTML microsites and emails</li>
<li>CMS building and theming using Drupal and Wordpress</li>
<li>Interaction and animation using Flash and ActionScript</li>
<li>Print and packaging design</li>
</ul>
