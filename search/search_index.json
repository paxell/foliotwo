My expertise in product design for data-driven web applications draws from a wide range of experiences in the design of games, mobile apps, logos and branding. I work with product managers and researchers, leading a design team to take user needs and propose solutions for them: wireframe, prototype, test, iterate, repeat. I work with developers and quality assurance until the user need is satisfied within the current constraints. Although products can be released, I understand they are never 'done'. A user needs the products they use to evolve with them as technology marches forward and their expectations change. Areas of strength Product strategy: from print to screen, desktop to mobile, native desktop to cloud application, I've spent a lot of time figuring out how to take a product from one stage of it's life cycle to another. Managing constraints: even considering legacy architecture, release schedules and budget constraints, there are always ways to improve a product from micro-interactions to macro re-platforming. Improving processes: applying the same agile principles of product development to the processes we rely on to keep things moving in the wider business, and always re-evaluating: did that work? Connecting silos: highlighting common goals while appreciating the individual contributions of geographically distributed interdisciplinary team members (say that five times fast). Areas of interest Business needs: Squaring user needs with business needs is a fine balance. As designers we want our users to have everything, as a business we need to ask ourselves: what adds the most value? Designing automation: Products should make themselves (almost) redundant so that users spend less time working with the app and let the app work for them. I have only just begun to scratch the surface here. Leadership: I've implemented recruitment processes which improved hiring. I've co-ordinated a team of designers and supervised junior designers but I'm always learning more about how best to lead a design team. Active skills and tools User flows, wireframing and prototyping Mockups and pattern libraries with design tools such as Sketch Designing workshops with collaboration tools such as Miro Styling with CSS and CSS preprocessors JavaScript and common libraries such as React Agile software methodology Version control using Git Adobe CC: Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign Retired skills and tools Why would I include these? In my career evolving products from one stage to another, I have used many tools, some of which I no longer use but have taught me a lot along the way. Hand coded HTML microsites and emails CMS building and theming using Drupal and Wordpress Interaction and animation using Flash and ActionScript Print and packaging design Case study (more coming soon) Static to interactive: QAGOMA Map 2016 Contact me I am currently based in Brisbane, Australia and working remotely.

Previously, static images of each floor were provided on the website and up-to-date maps including exhibition information could only be found in brochures. An interactive map would gather data from the website calendar to automatically provide up-do date information on exhibitions. Map in use on an iPad User needs The primary users would be current or future visitors to the gallery. The gallery is spread across two buildings, 5 minutes walk apart. Users commonly didn't know which of the two buildings was holding the exhibition they had come to see before arriving at the gallery. Other frequent users would be gallery services staff who could assist wayfinding in person by showing the maps to visitors on tablet devices. The map needed to show: Current exhibitions across both buildings on multiple floors Gallery services such as the research library and cafe Amenities and other features of the buildings such as lifts and bathrooms Constraints The solution needed to be compatible with the gallery website\u2019s layout and style guide All map assets needed to be stored in and retrieved from the gallery\u2019s squizMatrix CMS platform Information about exhibitions and events was stored in JSON Process Requirement gathering Technical investigation Mockups Stakeholder feedback Interactive mockups Further feedback and approval CMS integration Publishing to live site Requirement gathering I spoke with various stakeholders to get the initial requirements for the interactive map. Highlighting exhibitions: The map pins and exhibition listing should update automatically from the exhibition calendar Gallery services: Services such as the gallery\u2019s research library with links to their web pages should be accessible from the map Mobile friendly: The interface should adapt for use on mobile devices Accessible: needed to be high contrast and zoomable Initial sketch Technical investigation I selected Leaflet.js as a library for the map. I created custom map tiles from PDFs, mapping out the coordinates of each building feature and converting them to JSON to show each feature as a pin with an informational toolip. The website JSON was drawn in to populate the exhibition information and images into the tooltips. Interactive mockups I produced interactive mockups for final approval and testing. Many tweaks were made to optimise the user experience, especially on mobile. Interactive mockup Lessons learnt Performance: the interactive mockup was not a good indication of performance, retrieving assets through the CMS added to load time, especially the first load of the map. JSON configuration: this format worked really well with the existing site information and also to store the map data. It should be easy to modify if and when the layout of either gallery changes. Designing for re-use: The same map engine was subsequently used for an internal app for fire safety training. A more detailed version of the maps were used with pins to show the locations of all fire safety equipment and fire exits. The map is still in use on the QAGOMA website .","title":"Case study"},{"location":"case-studies/static-to-interactive/#static-to-interactive-qagoma-map-2016","text":"Queensland Art Gallery / Gallery of Modern Art needed an interactive solution for wayfinding that showcased both of the gallery\u2019s buildings.
